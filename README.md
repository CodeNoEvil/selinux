This is a repository for my own SELinux policies

These will not work on Fedora or any other "bleeding edge" systems so use only on RHEL 6.x, CentOS 6.x

All the policies can be copied and used freely but I give them no quarantees regarding security, functionality or if these kill your production systems.
I strongly recommend using a testlab and modify the policies to match your needs!
